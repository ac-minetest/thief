HOW TO USE:
-----------
0. craft glove, equip it. 
1. To CLOAK (hide) your name temporarily use glove while not pointing at any player.
2. To STEAL: sneak behind player, point at him and use glove. After that wait 5s before using glove again and then you can take one item from players pockets (top inventory row only).
